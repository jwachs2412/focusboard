# API Overview

### Auth Routes

- `POST /auth/register` – Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` – Login and receive JWT

### Task Routes (Protected)

- `GET /tasks` – Get user tasks
- `POST /tasks` – Create a task
- `PUT /tasks/:id` – Update a task
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` – Delete a task

---

# 🏗 Architecture Decisions

This application follows a full-stack separation of concerns:

```
Frontend (React) → API (Express) → Services → Database (MongoDB)
```

### Feature-Based Structure

Task-related components are grouped inside `components/tasks/` — this keeps feature logic colocated and scalable.

### State Management

Task state is abstracted into a custom hook (`useTasks`) which separates business logic from UI composition.

### Services Layer (Backend)

Business logic is moved to **services** so controllers remain lightweight.

```
Route → Controller → Service → Database
```

Benefits:

- Cleaner route handlers
- Reusable logic
- Easier testing
- Better separation of concerns

### Single Source of Truth

All task mutations live inside `useTasks` — this prevents state inconsistencies between components.

### Derived State

Active task count is derived from `tasks` rather than stored separately to prevent state drift.

### Type Safety

A centralized `Task` type ensures consistency across components.

# Security Flow

```
User Login
    ↓
Backend validates credentials
    ↓
JWT token generated
    ↓
Token stored in localStorage
    ↓
Frontend sends Authorization header
    ↓
Backend middleware verifies token
```

# Future Improvements

- Task due dates
- Task categories
- Drag-and-drop task ordering
- Refresh tokens
- User profiles
- Deployment with Docker
